<h1>Why Use Bootstrap?</h1>
Bootstrap reinforces the very important coding principle:    <b>DRY</b>.

<b>DRY</b> - <b>Don't Repeat Yourself!</b>

DRY code is more concise and easier to read.  Another benefit is if you have two code snippets depending on the same function (or rule), you can change the functionality of this function without needing to edit it in more than one place.

Another big advantage that Bootstrap provides is that it allows developers to build applications that have a responsive design.  A website built using Bootstrap appears to have been designed with the user's device screen size in mind, no matter what type of device the viewer is using (PC, phone, tablet, etc).
