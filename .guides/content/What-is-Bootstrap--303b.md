<h1>What is Bootstrap?</h1>
Bootstrap is a front-end framework for agile web design.  It prevents the need to rewrite many tedious style rules each time you start a new project for the web which uses HTML and CSS.  It does this by breaking down a lot of common design elements referred to as components and packaging them up for reuse.
